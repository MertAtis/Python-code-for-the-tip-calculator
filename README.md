# Python code for the tip calculator
 This program is a quick and easy way to calculate the amount each person should pay when splitting a bill, such as at a restaurant or for shared expenses.
 
Here's how it works:
The program asks the user to input the total bill amount, the number of people sharing the bill, and the tip percentage.
It calculates the tip amount by multiplying the bill amount by the tip percentage (as a decimal fraction).
It adds the tip amount to the bill amount to get the total bill (including tip).
It divides the total bill by the number of people sharing the bill to get the amount each person should pay.
It rounds the result to two decimal places.
It prints the final amount per person to the console.
